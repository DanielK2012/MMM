<div class="subtitle">The keyword concept of MMM</div>
<p>
Structure objects, such as residues, chains, or atoms can be annotated with information on function, biochemical experiments, observations in MD simulations etc. To easily find objects that are associated with a certain concept, such as substrate transport or pH-dependent structural changes, keywords can be assigned to objects in the <a href="annotation_window.html">annotation window</a>.
</p>
<p>
To demonstrate the annotation and keyword concept the MMM distribution contains an annotated and referenced model for major plant light harvesting complex II (<code>LHCII_MMM.mat</code>).
</p>
<p>
The keyword finder window contains a list of keywords (left), a list of objects(right) and buttons for <a href="#selection">selecting objects</a>, for <a href="#annotation">displaying the annotation</a> that contains the keyword, and <a href="#close">closing the window</a>.
</p>
<a name="selection">
<div class="subtitle">Selection by keyword</div>
<p>
By default objects are added to the already existing selection, if any. If you want to start with a clean slate, first click the <code>Clear</code> button.
<p>
If you click on an item in the <code>Keywords</code> list, the <code>Referring objects</code> list is filled with all objects that have an annotation with this keyword. Only a single keyword can be picked at once. You can then pick one or several objects from the <code>Referring objects</code> list (hold down the <code>Shift</code> or <code>Ctrl</code> keys during clicking for picking multiple objects). By clicking the <code>Select</code> button, you add all picked objects to the selection. Alternatively, you can use the <code>Select all</code> button to add all objects from the <code>Referring objects</code> list to the selection.
</p>
<a name="annotation">
<div class="subtitle">Displaying annotation</div>
<p>
To display the <a href="annotation_window.html">annotation</a> of a picked object, click the <code>Show annotation</code> button. If several objects are picked in the <code>Referring objects</code> list, the annotation will be shown for the first picked item. Note that this and only this object will be selected after the annotation window is opened. If a selection of objects exists when you click the button, a question dialog opens and you are given the opportunity to cancel your request and keep the old selection.
</p>
<p>
If the keyword corresponds to an automatic annotation made by MMM (e.g., when reading the PDB file or in spin labeling), the annotation window opens at the corresponding automatic annotation page. Otherwise the annotation window opns at page 1 and you may have to click through the pages to find the remark that corresponds to the keyword.
</p>
<p>
Note also that you can return to the keyword finder only after you have closed the <a href="annotation_window.html">annotation window</a>.
<p>
<a name="close">
<div class="subtitle">Closing the window</div>
<p>
Click the <code>OK</code> button. All existing selections will be kept.

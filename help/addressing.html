<div class="subtitle">General address format</div>
<p>
[<i>structure</i>](<i>chain</i>){<i>coordinate set</i>}<i>residue</i>.<i>atom</i>:<i>location</i>  
</p>
<p>
Parts of the address may be missing, as specified in <a href="#defaults">Defaults</a>. A slightly modified format is used for <a href="domain_addressing.html">addressing secondary structure elements and domains</a>.
<ul>
<li> <i>structure</i>- structure identifier, either the number of the structure or the PDB identifier or a user-defined <a href="#synonym">synonym</a>
<li> <i>chain</i>- chain identifier, character (A-Z) or a user-defined <a href="#synonym">synonym</a>
<li> <i>coordinate set</i>- number of the coordinate set within an ensemble of structures (e.g. NMR structures)
<li> <i>residue</i>- residue number
<li> <i>atom</i>- atom identifier, usually up to two characters, with atom identifiers for common residues and cofactors being defined in PDB template files
<li> <i>location</i>- location identifier, up to two characters, both letters, only required if an atom has <a href="#alternate">alternate locations</a>
</ul>
<h4>Examples:</h4>
<p>
<code>[2BHW](B)123.CA</code>
</p>
<p>
addresses the C<sup><smaller>&alpha <larger></sup> atom of residue 123 of chain B in the structure with PDB identifier 2BHW (major plant light harvesting complex IIb)
</p>
<p>
<code>[2CUU]131.N1:B</code>
<p>
addresses location B of the nitroxide N atom (<i>atom identifier</i>: N1) of residue 131 (R1A, a cystein labeled by MTSL) in the structure with PDB identifier 2CUU (spin-labeled T4 lysozyme)
</p>
<a name="special">
<div class="subtitle">Special addresses (shortcuts)</div>
<p>
<ul>
<li>The asterisk <code>*</code> addresses all currently selected objects.</li>
<li>The exclamation mark <code>!</code> addresses the current structure, shown in the title of the main window.</li>
<li>The <code>#</code> character addresses the current chain, shown in the title of the main window.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<a name="special">
<div class="subtitle">Special addresses (surfaces, densities, motion arrows)</div>
<p>
Surface objects, such as <a href="menu_display.html#density">densities</a> or <a href="menu_build.html#SAS">solvent accessible surfaces</a> and also sets of motion arrows have addresses that start with a dollar sign <code>$</code>, followed by a type identifier, and a tag that is unique for the given type (format: <code>$<i>type</i>:<i>tag</i></code>), where type is <code>density</code> for density objects, <code>SAS</code> for solvent accessible surfaces, and <code>motion</code> for sets of motion arrows.
</p>
<i>Example:</i>
<p>
<code>$SAS:SAS_1</code> addresses the solvent accessible surface with tag "SAS_1".
<p>
Surface and motion arrow addresses cannot be used in all places where addresses of structure objects can be used. They are supported only by the <a href="commands.html#show">show</a>, <a href="commands.html#hide">hide</a>, <a href="commands.html#color">color</a>, <a href="commands.html#transparency">transparency</a>, and <a href="commands.html#delete">delete</a> commands.
</p>
<a name="defaults">
<div class="subtitle">Defaults</div>
<ul>
<li> <i>structure</i>- defaults to the current structure, which is displayed in the title bar of the <a href="main_window.html">main window</a>
<li> <i>chain</i>- defaults to the current chain, which is displayed in the title bar of the <a href="main_window.html">main window</a>
<li> <i>coordinate set</i>- often there is only a single coordinate set and this part of the address can be left out, otherwise <i>all coordinate sets</i> are addressed simultaneously if this part is missing
<li> <i>residue</i>- should always be specified, use <code>:</code> (colon) to address all residues in a chain
<li> <i>atom</i>- if atom identifier is missing, the whole residue is addressed
<li> <i>location</i>- often there is only a single location and this part can be left out; otherwise <i>all alternative locations</i> are addressed if this part is missing
</ul>
<h4>Examples:</h4>
<p>
<code>123</code>
</p>
<p>
addresses residue 123 of the current chain in the current structure
</p>
<p>
<code>(C):.CA</code>
addresses all C<sup><smaller>&alpha <larger></sup> atoms in chain C of the current structure
<div class="subtitle">Addressing several objects at once (list addressing)</div>
<p>
Several structures, chains, coordinate sets, residues, atoms, or locations can be addressed at once by replacing identifiers with comma-separated lists.
</p>
<h4>Examples:</h4>
<p>
<code>[2BHW](A,C)96.CB</code>
</p>
<p>
addresses the C<sup><smaller>&beta <larger></sup> atoms of residues 96 in both chains A and C of structure 2BHW (but not in chain B of this structure)
</p>
<p>
<code>[2BHW](A,C)96,123.CA,CB</code>
</p>
addresses the C<sup><smaller>&alpha <larger></sup> and C<sup><smaller>&beta <larger></sup> atoms of residues 96 and 123 in chains A and C of structure 2BHW
</p>
<p>
Such list addressing accepts that certain combinations may not exist. For instance, if residue 123 were a glycine, its C<sup><smaller>&alpha <larger></sup> atom would be addressed and no error would be returned although there is no C<sup><smaller>&beta <larger></sup> atom. 
<p>
A continuous range of residues can be addressed by using a hyphen.  
</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p>
<code>[2BHW](A)96-123.CA</code>
</p>
<p>
addresses the C<sup><smaller>&alpha <larger></sup> atoms of residues 96-123 in chain A of structure 2BHW
</p>
<p>
Note that addressing a large number of objects via a combination of list tags can lead to noticeable computation times for address resolution.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Addressing residues and atoms by type</div>
<p>
Residues and cofactors can be addressed by their PDB residue types, enclosed in double quotation marks. This can be combined with list addressing by a comma-separated list. MMM accepts common nomenclature "Xaa" for any natural amino acid residue (thus excluding modified amino acids and cofactors), "Asx" to abbreviate "Asn","Asp" and "Glx" to abbreviate "Gln","Glu".
</p>
<h4>Examples:</h4>
<code>[2CUU]"R1A".N1,O1</code>
<p>
addresses the nitroxide group nitrogen and oxygen atoms of all residues R1A (cystein labeled by MTSL) in the structure with PDB identifier 2CUU.
</p>
<code>[2BHW]"CHL","CLA"</code>
<p>
addresses all chlorophyll a and b molecules in all chains of the structure with PDB identifier [2BHW].
</p>
<p>
Atoms can be addressed by element.
</p>
<h4>Examples</h4>
<code>."Fe"</code>
<p>
addresses all iron atoms in the current chain of the current structure.
</p>
<a name="alternate">
<div class="subtitle">Working with alternate locations</div>
<p>
Alternate loctions are often specified for only a few atoms in a structure, chain, or residue. To address all atoms (using the single location of those atoms that do not have alternate locations), use the address format given above.
</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p>
<code>[2CUU]"R1A".B</code>
</p>
<p>
addresses all residues with type R1A in structure 2CUU, selecting location B for all those atoms which do have alternate locations.
</p>
<p>
If you want to inspect only atoms with alternate locations, use an exclamation mark <code>!</code> to enforce location addressing.
</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p>
<code>[2CUU]"R1A","ASN".:B!</code>
</p>
<p>
addresses only atoms with alternate locations, and of those only location B, for residues of types R1A and ASN in structure 2CUU
</p>
<a name="synonym">
<div class="subtitle">Synonyms for structure and chain identifiers</div>
<p>
For convenience, MMM allows to define synonyms for structure and chain identifiers. For instance, after defining the synonym LHCIIb for structure 2BHW using a <a href="commands.html">command</a>, <code>[LHCIIb](A)123.CA</code> addresses the C<sup><smaller>&alpha <larger></sup> atom of residue 123 of chain A in structure 2BHW.
</p>
<p>
Usually, such synonyms will be the established names of the proteins or protein complexes, however, the user is completely free in the choice of synonym.

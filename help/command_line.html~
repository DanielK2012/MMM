<div class="subtitle">What can you do with the command line?</div>
<p>
Part of the functionality of MMM is available via <a href="commands.html">commands</a>. In particular, selection of objects and change of the graphics mode, color, and transparency of objects are often more conveniently done via commands than via clicks. This applies even more to definitions of domains and secondary structure elements. Commands can be collected in <A href="scripting.html">scripts</A>.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Behaviour of the command line</div>
<p>
The command line can only be selected, when the main window cursor is in selection mode (button <img src="img/toolbar_select.png" alt="(cursor arrow)"> is activated, buttons <img src="img/toolbar_rotate.png" alt="(circular arrow)"> and <img src="img/toolbar_zoom.png" alt="(diagonal double arrow)"> are deactivated) or if the <a href="model_panel.html">model panel</a> is detached as a <a href="model_window.html">model window</a>.
</p>
<p>
If not selected the command line has the grey background of the main window. Any commands that are performed from a script or by menu and tool button functions are echoed with dark grey letters and are added to the command history list.
</p>
<p>
When selected, the command line becomes white. Click twice to see the cursor. A right click clears the command line (but not the history list). Commands can be directly written into the line. Previously issued commands can be selected by the cursor up (&uarr) and down (&darr) keys. To actually execute a command, press the Return (&crarr) key.
</p>
<p>
The command <code>help</code> displays the <a href="commands.html">list of available commands</a> in the <A href="message_board.html">message board</A>.
</p>
<div class="subtitle"><img src="img/reficon.gif" alt="(two pages with text)"> Script button</div>
<p>
Allows to run a command <A href="scripting.html">script</A>. By default, scripts are expected in the <code>/scripts</code> subdirectory of the MMM directory and to have the extension <code>.mmm</code>, although files with other extensions can be loaded.
</p>
<p>
Commands in the script are echoed in the command line and added to the command history list. Comments are echoed in the <A href="message_board.html">message board</A>.

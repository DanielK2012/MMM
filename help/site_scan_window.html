<div class="subtitle">What can you do in the site scan setup?</div>
<p>
This window appears when a spin labeling site scan is initiated from the <a href="menu_epr.html#site_scan"> EPR/Site scan</a> menu item and the selection or current chain contain only amino acid residues. Here you can select which residue types
are included in the site scan and you can determine what analysis of the set of labeled residues should be performed.
</p>
<a name="residue_types">
<div class="subtitle">Residue types</div>
<p>
This allows to restrict a sites scan to certain types of residues. In a site scan of a chain or several chains, a "conservative" site scan, including only cysteine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine,
serine, threonine, and valine is the default. You can override this and scan all residues by selecting the radiobutton <code>all</code> or you can include or exclude certain residue types by changing the state of the corresponding checkboxes.
<p>
In a site scan of selected residues, the default is that all these residues are scanned.
</p>
<a name="z_analysis">
<div class="subtitle">Membrane depth analysis</div>
<p>
In a membrane protein, you might want to know where spin labels are situated with respect to the lipid bilayer. If you have created a <a href="build_bilayer.html">lipid bilayer</a> the <i>z</i> axis is
the bilayer normal and <i>z</i>=0 corresponds to the central plane of the bilayer. You can analyze all spin-labelled residues for their mean <i>z</i> coordinate and distribution width of the <i>z</i> coordinate by 
activating the <code>z axis is unique axis</code> checkbox.
</p>
<a name="distance_analysis">
<div class="subtitle">Distance analysis</div>
<p>
If the scan contains at least two residues, intraspin distances can be analyzed. For large site scans, the computation time and result file size of a complete distance analysis can be 
rather larger. Therefore it is recommended to restrict the analysis to the information that you really need.
</p>
<p>
Distances between residues within the same chain are intrachain distances. You can include or exclude them from analysis, by activating radiobutton <code>all</code> or <code>none</code>, respecively.
</p>
<p>
Distances between residues in different chains are interchain distances. You can include all interchain distances, only distances between residues with the same number in different chains, or exclude all of them from analysis, by activating radiobuttons <code>all</code>, <code>equivalent</code>, or <code>none</code>, respecively.
</p>
<p>
In a homooligomer (with perfect symmetry), analysis can be sped up by performing the site scan for only a single chain and creating spin label positions in other monomers by symmetry. This assumes that the <i>z</i> axis is the symmetry axis. The multiplicity of the axis (2 for homodimer, 3 for trimer, ...) must be specified.
</p>
<a name="statistics">
<div class="subtitle">Additional statistics files</div>
<p>
By default, analysis output is written to a HTML file and displayed in a web browser. If you want to track a problem or use quantitative information in other analysis programs, clear text output may be preferable.
<p>
To generate text files with full statistics output, activate the checkbox <code>Save statistics</code>. To save separate PDB files for all rotamers with significant population, activate the checkbox <code>Save PDB rotamers</code>. Be careful in both cases, but in particular with the saving of PDB files. In a large site scan this can easily create thousands or even tens of thousands of PDB files.

<div class="subtitle">What can you do with the reference window?</div>
<p>
The reference window of MMM is a basic, self-contained reference manager with PubMed search function, web access to Abstracts and full texts, a range of import and export options and the possibility of weakly automatic updates of bibliographies by PubMed searches. You could actually generate MMM projects (models) that contain only a bibliography and use MMM purely as a reference manager. You can also use it in conjunction with EndNote or BibTeX.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, MMM models with actual protein structures may have references to papers, books, and webpages associated with <a href="annotation_window.html">annotations</a> of an <a href="objects.html">object</a>, such as a structure, a peptide chain, a residue, or even an atom. For that reason the reference window can be either accessed via the <code>New</code> and <code>Edit</code> buttons in the <code>References</code> part of the <a href="annotation_window.html">annotation window</a> or via the <a href="menu_edit.html#references">Edit/References</a> menu item or the <a href="toolbar.html#references"><img src="img/book_sim.gif" alt="(blue book)">References</a> toolbutton. If the reference window is accessed from the annotation window, it is modal, i.e., no other MMM (or Matlab) window can be accessed before closing it again. To manage references or look at abstracts and full text, better access the window via the toolbutton or menu.
<p>
The reference window allows to input references by <a href="#search">PubMed search</a>, by import from  <a href="#EndNote">EndNote</a>,  BibTeX, <a href="#ISI">ISI Web of Knowledge</a>, <a href="#SciFinder">SciFinder</a>, <a href="#Google">Google Scholar</a> or by <a href="#direct">direct manual input</a>. Existing references can be edited.
</p>
<p>
References can be <a href="#BibTeX_out">exported in BibTex format</a> and in a format that can be read by <a href="#EndNote_out">EndNote</a>. They can also be <a href="#copy_save">saved or copied to the clipboard</a> in citation formats for several journals.
<p>
The <code>Search</code> button also allows to <a href="search_PubMed.html#internal">search for a reference within the existing bibliography.</a>
</p>
<p>
Structures imported from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) often contain already one ore more references from the JRNL and REMARK 1 records. Bibliographic information is incomplete in the PDB, hence these references are automatically "repaired" via PubMed if the computer is online during PDB reading and if the PDB file lists the PubMed ID of the reference.
</p>
<h4>### Warning ###</h4>
<p>
The reference window is automatically closed if a new model is loaded or graphics is redisplayed. You may loose edited and imported references. Please complete your work in the reference window before you do other things.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Adding a bibliography to a model</div>
<p>
An MMM model contains at least one structure, possibly several structures. You may have a literature list for the proteins whose structures these are or you may assemble it via search engines.
</p>
<a name="search">
<h4>Direct search</h4>
<p>
MMM can directly <a href="search_PubMed.html">search PubMed</a> and import the results. By setting up <a href="search_PubMed.html#automatic">automatic searches</a> the references of a model can be always kept up to date. For this you have to specify the concepts that are most relevant for this model or authors who publish often on similar structures.
</p>
<h4>Import</h4>
<p>
MMM supports several <code>Import/Export formats</code>, which can be selected via the corresponding popup menu at the bottom left of the reference window. These are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>MEDLINE</code>, a tagged text format that can be exported by PubMed</li>
<li><code>SciFinder tagged format</code>, a text export format of CAS SciFinder</li>
<li><code>ISI CGI</code>, the export format of ISI Web of Knowledge intended for EndNote, RefMan, and ProCite</li>
<li><code>EndNote text export</code>, a tagged clear text format that can be exported from EndNote</li>
<li><code>BibTeX</code>, a LaTex bibliography format that can be exported by Google Scholar</li>
<li><code>MMM</code>, the own bibliography format of MMM, which preserves all information when transferring references between MMM projects</li></ul>
<p>
After selecting the format, clicking on the <code>Import</code> button opens a file dialog for selection of the bibliography files. Several bibliography files, even in different formats can be imported after each other. With MEDLINE (PubMed) import, MMM checks whether the new references are unique, i.e., whether a reference with the same PubMed ID already exists. In that case, it is updated rather than added, the old short name is kept and an existing DOI is kept, if PubMed does not provide a DOI. Note that this does not work if the same reference exists, but was first imported without PubMed ID (or was directly input).
</p>
<a name="direct">
<h4>Direct input</h4>
<p>
You can also directly type your reference into the provided mask. For that, you first select the <code>Reference type</code> in the corresponding popup menus (top right). Defined reference types are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Article</li>
<li>Book</li>
<li>Book section</li>
<li>Webpage</li>
<li>Conference</li>
<li>Dissertation</li>
<li>Preprint</li>
<li>Patent</li>
</ul>
<p>
Depending on reference type, certain fields of the input mask may change their title. It is not required to fill all fields of the mask. To input the next reference, use the <code>&gt;</code> button of the <code>Reference number</code> control. The current reference is temporarily stored.
</p>
<h4>Editing short names</h4>
<p>
References are most easily referred to by mnemonic short names, such as <i>Einstein:1905</i> for a paper written by Albert Einstein in 1905. If a bibliography is imported in BibTeX format, such short names are usually already defined (for instance, Google&trade; Scholar export to BibTeX generates them automatically). For <a href="search_PubMed.html">PubMed searches</a> and MEDLINE import the mnemonic short names are appended with an underscore and the unique PubMed identifier (PMID) to make sure that the short names are unique (example:  <code>Puskin:1975_162831</code>. You can remove the PMID and underscore if you wish. MMM will check whether the short name is still unique. Otherwise, append characters, such as in <code>Puskin:1975b</code>.
<P>
For import other than from BibTeX and MEDLINE you can replace the default short names of MMM (reference numbers in square brackets) by your own mnemonic names. Edit the <code>Short name</code> field for that. MMM will check whether a given short name already exists. In that case a message box pops up and the old short name is retained. 
</p>
<h4>Input an URL</h4>
A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) can be input for any reference type by changing the type to Webpage, editing the <code>URL</code> field, and changing back. The URL will then still be displayed istead of editors. Note however that for edited books and sections of edited books this makes the <code>Editors</code> field inaccessible.
</p>
<h4>Finishing bibliography input</h4>
<p>
After finishing your input, click the <code>OK</code> button to store all new references with the model. Clicking the <code>Cancel</code> button will cancel <i>all edits</i> done after the reference window was opened (there is a query whether you really wnat to do that). The reference window will close and the reference list will be updated in the <a href="annotation_window.html">annotation window</a>.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Recommendations on search engines</div>
<h4>PubMed</h4>
<p>
This is for free, easy to work with, and usually sufficient for work on protein structures (see also <a href="search_PubMed.html">Search PubMed</a>). However, it does cover less literature than CAS SciFinder, ISI Web of Knowledge, or Google Scholar. As of October 27th 2009, PubMed provided more Digital Object Identifiers than any other search engine. This is the preferred way for <a href="#fulltext">fulltext access</a>. Due to the unique PubMed identifiers, MMM can also check whether a reference does already exist. Unless you are searching for references that are only remotely related to a biological system or want to include dissertations, PubMed is the engine of choice.
</p>
<h4>CAS SciFinder</h4>
<p>
If you have access to this expensive search machine, it will usually give the most complete answers, as the database is based on a well thought keyword system and keyword assignement is not left to authors and journals. SciFinder searches may turn out some references twice (once with proper publication year and once with the publication year in the publication date field). Use the remove duplicates link above the reference list to avoid this. Unlike all the other search engines, SciFinder also lists dissertations. It also lists a few books, but these ones with lousy bibliographic information (no publisher, no ISBN).
</p>
<h4>ISI Web of Knowledge</h4>
<p>
This is not for free either, but it is a choice that may provide more references than PubMed. You will miss references if the keywords are not in the title or abstract or journal keyword field. ISI Web of Knowledge provides Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for newer literature.
</p>
<h4>Google Scholar</h4>
<p>
This is also for free and has good coverage of literature. It is not so convenient to work with, in particular because each reference has to be saved individually and references are always sorted by number of citations. Unlike ISI Web of Knowledge and PubMed it also finds books.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Editing references</div>
<h4>Browse references</h4>
<p>
You can browse references by using the <code>&lt;</code> and <&gt;> buttons of the <code>Reference number</code> field. To go to the last reference, input a very large number into the <code>Reference number</code> edit field. Clicking the <code>&gt;</code> button again at the last reference inserts a new reference with empty fields.
</p>
<h4>Accessing a reference by its short name</h4>
<p>
Use the <code>?</code> button above the <code>Short name</code> field. 
</p>
<h4>Deleting a reference</h4>
<p>
Use the <code>Delete</code> button near the <code>Reference number</code> field. Note that references that are linked to annotations (objects) cannot be deleted (MMM checks this).
</p>
<h4>Editing bibliographic information</h4>
<p>
Note that MMM offers to automatically update bibliographic information when you access the <a href="#abstract">abstract</a> via PubMed. Hence, edited information may be overwritten. Exceptions are the short name, which is never updated on reimport and the DOI, which is updated only if the PubMed record really provides one (an existing DOI is not erased). If you want to edit other fields and keep your own information, you should not accept the update.
</p>
<p>
For journal articles, it is more advisable to rely on the automatic updates of bibliographic information. For books, book sections, dissertations, websites, and conference proceedings bibliographic information in common data bases is usually lousy, and you <i>do</i> want to edit it (abstracts are rarely accessible from PubMed anyway for these reference types).
</p>
<a name="abstract">
<div class="subtitle">Abstract display and updating of bibliographic information</div>
<p>
Although MMM does not store abstracts, it can download them from the internet if the PubMed identifier (PMID) is supplied with the reference (default for MEDLINE import or literature search from within MMM) or if enough information is available to find the reference in PubMed. If no PMID is available, MMM uses nmaes of all authors with at most one initial, the journal name, and the year in the initial search. The abstract of the first (newest) matching reference is displayed. If the initial search turns out several matches, MMM searches for the reference with matching volume and first page. A warning is shown that the displayed abstract is not the abstract of the matching reference. In this case, accept the matching reference for update and click the <code>Abstract</code> button once again to see the matching abstract.  
</p>
<p>
The abstract is displayed in a browser window, author address and keywords are also displayed, if they are available. The publication language is shown and, for reviews, the number of references is given. Note that abstract display requires internet access. If the connection is broken, an error message is displayed in the message board of the main window.
</p>
<p>
If the reference (or a likely candidate) could be localized, MMM asks whether this reference should be accepted for update of the bibliographical information. Accept it unless you have very good reasons not to.
</p>
<p>
If the reference cannot be localized, the journal may just not be covered by PubMed (at least not the volume you are looking for) or it may be wrong (this happens more often than you would think). Depending on the information you have, you may try to localize the reference with the <a href="search_PubMed.html">PubMed search</a> of MMM or another literature database.
</p>
<a name="fulltext">
<div class="subtitle">Fulltext access</div>
<p>
References imported from ISI Web of Knowledge or PubMed may already have a Digital Object Identifier that you can see in the <code>DOI</code> field. By clicking the globe button <img src="img/webicon.gif" alt="(blue globe with green continents)"> the corresponding web page is loaded into a Matlab browser. Note that the reference window is modal if it was accessed from the annotation window. That means that the Matlab browser can be accessed only after these two windows have been closed (sorry, we have reasons for that). However, you can access the full text without closing the reference window, when you opened it via the toolbutton or <code>Edit</code> menu.
</p>
<p>
References imported from CAS SciFinder or Webpages may have a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) associated with them. This will be displayed in an URL field. By clicking the globe button <img src="img/webicon.gif" alt="(blue globe with green continents)"> the corresponding web page is loaded into a Matlab browser. See above for accessibility of the browser window.
</p>
<p>
If the DOI is not available, MMM tries to locate the fulltext via SFX. Please check before, whether PubMed can retrieve the DOI (use the <code>Abstract</code> button), as even the two-step process Abstract/DOI is faster and often more convenient than SFX. For SFX access, the library of your institution needs to have an SFX server and MMM needs to know its internet address. You can find this address when you access SFX from another literature data base or you can ask your librarian.
This address needs to be input in the file <code>initialize_MMM.m</code> which is found in the MMM main directory, e.g. <code>web_adr.SFX='sfx.ethz.ch:9003/sfx_locater';</code>. A later version of MMM will have a preferences window to make this more convenient.
</p>
<p>
Occasionally SFX cannot locate the full text, although the bibliographical information is correct and your institution does have fulltext access to this journal and time period. The SFX server will then simply claim that there is no full text available. In such cases you may want to access the homepage of the journal and click through its archives (the hard way). Journal homepage also often help if bibliographic information is incomplete or incorrect (many have their own search engine).
</p>
<p>
Note also that fulltext access for paid journals will work only if you are in the web domain of an institution with a subscription. Free journals can be accessed from everywhere, even via SFX with the ETH Zurich server (courtesy of the IDS Swiss German Library Network).

MMM can export in ISI .cgi format, for which <a href="#EndNote_out">EndNote</a> has an import filter, in <a href="#BibTeX_out">BibTeX</a> format and in a MEDLINE-like format. The MEDLINE-like format is supported because it preserves PubMed identifiers and can be used to exchange reference lists between MMM models. Export in SciFinder tagged format or EndNote text export format is not possible.
</p>
<a name="EndNote_out">
<h4>EndNote</h4>
<p>
Select <code>ISI CGI</code> in the <code>Import/Export format</code> popup menu and click the <code>Export</code> button. A file dialog appears for selecting directory and file name. The Message board in the main window reports that the file was saved and gives the file name. The following information is stored:
<h5>PT (document type)</h5>
<ul>
<li><code>J</code> for articles and reviews</li>
<li><code>B</code> for books</li>
<li><code>S</code> for book sections</li>
<li><code>W</code> for webpages (non-standard)</li>
<li><code>C</code> for conferences (non-standard)</li>
<li><code>D</code> for dissertations (non-standard)</li>
<li><code>P</code> for patents</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Apart from that the title (TI), author list (AU), document type (DT, Article or Review), journal (JI), volume (VL), issue (IS), first (BP) and last (EP) page and the publication year (PY) and, if available, the DOI (DI) are stored. For patents, the patent number (PN) is also stored.
</p>
To import the references into EndNote, use the <code>File/Import..</code> menu item and select <code>ISI-CE</code> as the import option with <code>No translation</code>. For dissertations, the university information will be found in the <codes>Notes</code> field of the EndNote record. For patents, the country has to be inferred from the first two characters of the patent number.
<p>
(tested with EndNote X2)
</p>
<a name="BibTeX_out">
<h4>BibTeX</h4>
<p>
BibTex export stores the short name and supports document types <code>@article</code>,  <code>@book</code>, <code>@inbook</code> (book section), <code>@conference</code>, and <code>@phdthesis</code> (dissertation). The <code>school</code> field of the <code>@phdthesis</code> record is taken from the <code>Corporate Source</code> field in SciFinder records or has to be provided in the <code>Publisher</code> field of MMM for other input modes.
</p>
<p>
Webpages, preprints, and patents are stored as <code>@misc</code> records. Generally, <code>author</code>, <code>title</code>, <code>journal</code>, <code>year</code>, <code>volume</code>, <code>issue</code>, and <code>pages</code> fields are written. In addition, <code>publisher</code>, <code>location</code>, <code>book title</code>, <code>chapter</code>, <code>editors</code>, and <code>URL</code> fields are provided, if such information is present in the original records.
</p>
<p>
Note that results may depend on the formatting of imported references. Formatting was optimized for records obtained from PubMed. In particular, references imported from PDB files will give poor results if no PubMed ID is given in the PDB file.
</p>
<p>
MMM stores BibTex references with initials first, surnames last without commas, but accepts the version with surname first, comma, initials on import. Mixtures of full first names and initials with full stops in the same name will confuse the import filter.
</p>
<p>
For patents, you have to define your own output formatting. The patent country (code, such as <code>WO</code> for world, <code>EP</code> for European patent, <code>JP</code> for Japan) is provided in the field <code>country</code> and the number in the field <code>number</code> of the <code>@misc</code> style.

<div class="subtitle">Copying and saving in citation (text) formats</div>
<p>
The bottom panel <code>Save or copy to clipboard in citation format</code> can be used to print a nicely formatted list of the bibliography or to copy individual citations to a text processing program. The panel contains a listbox for selecting the journal (citation format), a popupmenu for selecting the save or copy format, checkboxes for selecting whther the number or short name should be included, and pushbuttons to <code>Copy</code> to the clipboard or to save the current reference or all references in the specified citation format. The bottom line in the panel shows a preview of the citation format for a fake test reference.
</p>
<h4>Selecting the journal (citation format)</h4>
<p>
Citation formats of a few journals are preprogrammed. The are given in a listbox in alphabetical order of the abbreviated journal name. You can either scroll through the whole list or preselect by the first letter or first two letters. To preselect, first click some journal name in the list. Now type the first letter of the wanted journal on the keyboard. The listbox will jump to the first journal that starts with this letter (if there is one). Now you can either scroll down or type the second letter while holding down the shift button. The listbox will jump to the first journal whose abbrevaited name starts with the two letters you typed (if there is one).
<p>
<i>Example:</i>
<p>
Click anywhere in the listbox and type <code>j &lt;Shift&gt p</code>. Now <code> J Phys Chem</code> will be selected.
<p>
If your journal (or a matching format) cannot be found and if you dare, you can <a href="citation_format.html">define a citation format</a> yourself. Otherwise <a href="mailto:gunnar.jeschke@phys.chem.ethz.ch?subject=MMM: citation format&body=Dear MMM authors, please implement the citation format for journal:">ask us</a> for implementing the required format.
<p>
<h4>Selecting output format</h4>
MMM can generate the citation in <code>LaTeX</code>, including italic and bold formatting of parts of the citation, as a <code>bibitem</code> for LaTeX, which will include the short name as a label for the reference, and as plain text (italic and bold formatting are lost). These three formats are available both with the clipboard and for saving the citation(s) to a file. The Rich Text Format <code>RTF</code> is available only for saving, as Matlab's clipboard function can export only strings. Files saved in RTF can be imported by Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, and indeed most text processor programs. Italic and bold formatting are preserved. The <code>HTML</code> format is used in web pages. Italic and bold formatting are preserved.
<h4>Including reference numbers or short names</h4>
The citation can be saved plain, without any identifier (unselect both checkboxes), with the reference number in brackets, or with the short name in bracktes. The last two modes are useful if you want a printout of the whole bibliography of a model.

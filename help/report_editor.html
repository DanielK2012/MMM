<div class="subtitle">What is the report editor?</div>
<p>
The report editor is mainly intended for displaying short text files created by MMM in a temporary folder to report results of computations. It allows to insert comments and to save the files. It can also be used as a small notepad. Furthermore it can be used to inspect short plain text (ASCII) files generated by other programs. For long files, such as PDB files, you might rather want to use the Matlab editor or another standalone editor.

<div class="subtitle">Limitations</div>
<p>
The report editor expects files with less than 80 characters/line. Other text files are displayed, but cannot be saved.
</p>
<a name="load">
<div class="subtitle">Load</div>
<p>
Any plain text (ASCII) file can be loaded via the <code>Load</code> button.
</p>
<a name="save">
<div class="subtitle">Save as</div>
<p>
Text files with less than 80 charcaters per line can be saved via the <code>Save as</code> button. Reports generated by MMM in the temporary folder can thus be saved to another folder if you want to keep them. Files older than 30 days are automatically cleared from the temporary folder.
</p>
<a name="OK">
<div class="subtitle">Closing the editor</div>
<p>
Clicking on the <code>OK</code> button closes the editor. UNless the editor is in read-only mode, there is a query whether you want to save changes (even if you did not make any changes).

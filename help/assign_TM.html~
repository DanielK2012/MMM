<div class="subtitle">Why should you assign helices and strands as "transmembrane"?</div>
<p>
Accessibility computations for membrane proteins require a lipid bilayer model. Such a model is also useful in visualizations as the function of a membrane protein can only be understood in relation to the membrane. The most simple lipid bilayer model has three parameters: the direction of the membrane normal (unit vector in z direction), the z coordinate of the bilayer center, and the bilayer thickness. For homooligomers, the membrane normal is along the <a href="menu_edit.html#symmetry">symmetry axis</a>. In other cases, the membrane normal can be approximated from the average direction of transmembrane helices or strands.
</p>
<p>
In ribbon plots, declared transmembrane helices and strands are shown with slightly stronger colors. This may also help to get a better overview of the structure of a membrane protein. If you do not like these color differences, you can apply the <a href="commands.html#colorscheme">colorscheme secondary</a> command. This results in the same color for all helices and strands.
</p>
<a name="by_command">
<div class="subtitle">Alternatives</div>
<p>
Transmembrane helices and strands can also be assigned directly with the <a href="commands.html#helix">helix</a> and <a href="commands.html#sheet">sheet</a> commands. In fact, the assignment is best done in an <a href="scripting.html#initialization">initialization script</a>. Even if you do that, the assignment window is required for determination of the membrane normal.
</p>
<p>
For building a bilayer you just need to orient the structure so that the z axis is the approximate membrane normal. This can also be done by visual inspection. You rotate the structure so that the &beta;-barrel or &alpha;-helix bundle appears to have the correct orientation. Either you try to look along the membrane normal, then your viewing direction should become the z axis of the structure. Or you look sideways on the protein (perpendicular to the membrane normal), then the viewing directions should become the x axis. Transform the structure to the membrane frame by using the <a href="menu_build.html#transform">Build/Transform to viewing frame/x along viewing vector</a> menu item or the <a href="menu_build.html#transform">Build/Transform to viewing frame/z along viewing vector</a>.
</p>
<p>
In complicated cases (large bundles with some helices sticking out of the membrane), assign TM helices with the helix command in a script, use the <a href="menu_edit.html#bundle">Assign TM helices and strands</a> menu item and the <code>OK</code> button to find the approximate normal, set the view along x, correct the orientation of the protein as good as you can (if you can) by rotating the structure, select the <a href="menu_build.html#transform">Build/Transform to viewing frame/x along viewing vector</a> menu item and finally fit the membrane normal in the <a href="build_bilayer.html">bilayer builder</a>.
</p>
<a name="assignment">
<div class="subtitle">Picking and unpicking transmembrane helices & strands</div>
<p>
The TM assignment window always relates to the current structure. The left listbox shows all helices and strands in all chains of this structure, using MMM's <a href="domain_addressing.html#secondary">secondary structure address format</a>. After a semi-colon (address delimiter), the range of residues is shown for easier comparison with the original publication on the structure.
</p>
<p>
If TM helices or strands are already declared then those are listed in the right listbox. Otherwise the right listbox is empty.
</p>
<p>
Helices or strands can be picked by clicking in the listbox (use the <code>Ctrl</code> or <code>Shift</code> keys for multiple selection) and assigned as "transmembrane" by the <code>&gt;</code> button. Double assignments of the same element are ignored. Assignments can be deleted by picking the helix or strand in the right listbox and using the <code>&lt;</code> button. All TM helices and strands can be unassigned at once with the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> button.
<p>
<a name="display">
<div class="subtitle">Displaying the membrane normal</div>
<p>
The membrane normal is computed and displayed with the <code>Show membrane normal</code> button. For this, direction vectors are computed for all selected TM helices and strands (thin red lines). These direction vectors are defined by minimum mean square deviation of all C<sup>&alpha;</sup> atoms from the line. The (approximate) membrane normal is the mean of all vectors, it is shown as a thick red line. Depending on the viewing angle, it may be easy or difficult to spot. 
<p>
If necessary, the vectors and normals can be hidden with the <code>Hide membrane normal</code> button. Otherwise they disappear automatically when the window is closed.
</p>
<a name="OK">
<div class="subtitle">Transforming into the bilayer frame</div>
<p>
For <a href="build_bilayer.html">building the bilayer</a> the structure has to be transformed to the bilayer frame. In this frame, the bilayer normal is the z axis and the origin is at the center of the mean direction vector of the &alpha;-helical bundle or &beta;-barrel. The origin thus approximately coincides with the center of the bilayer and the center of the bundle or barrel.
</p>
<p>
Transformation and redisplay are effected by the <code>OK</code> button. This also closes the window and hides the direction vectors and membrane normal.
</p>
<a name="cancel">
<div class="subtitle">Staying in the original frame</div>
<p>
The assignment window can also be used for just assigning TM helices and strands for visualization with a different color without transformation of the coordinate frame. For this, use the <code>Cancel</code> button. The window is closed, all current assignments from the right listbox are kept, and the direction vectors and membrane normal are hidden.
</p>
<p>
If you choose the <code>Cancel</code> button, subsequent building of a bilayer will not work, unless you have previously set the proper z axis via <a href="menu_edit.html#symmetry">symmetry</a>. You can always return to this window via the <a href="menu_edit.html#bundle">Assign TM helices and strands</a> menu item and click <code>OK</code> to perform the transformation.

<div class="subtitle">Site scan</div>
<h4>selected chains or current chain</h4>
<p>
Scans selected chains for spin labeling sites that are favourable for accessibility or distance measurements. See also <a href="spin_labeling.html">spin labeling</a>. Note that a site scan can take hours to complete. The results are stored with the model and a report is stored as an HTML file and opened in a Matlab browser. The structure remains unchanged, i.e., labels are not actually attached.
</p>
<h4>selected residues</h4>
<p>
Computes rotamers of a spin label for all currently selected residues. See also <a href="spin_labeling.html">spin labeling</a>. Note that a site scan takes 1-2 minutes per selected residue. The results are stored with the model and a report is stored as an HTML file and opened in a Matlab browser. The structure remains unchanged, i.e., labels are not actually attached.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">Label</div>
<p>
Spin-label selected residues. All rotamers with sufficiently low energy will be attached as alternate locations. Computation of the rotamers takes a minute or several minutes per residue. Label type and experimental conditions are specified in the <a href="spin_labeling.html">labeling window</a>. If rotamers were previously computed in a site scan, labeling takes only seconds rather than minutes.
</p>
<div class="subtitle">DEER</div>
<p>
Predict distance distributions between labelled sites and DEER data. Predictions can be superimposed with experimental data. For this to make sense at least two residues must have been spin-labelled in the same structure. See <a href="deer_window.html">DEER window</a> for further explanation. 
</p>
<a name="accessibility">
<div class="subtitle">Accessibility</div>
<p>
Predicts accessibility measures for water, oxygen, or NiEDDA for a spin-labelled site. Previous computation of spin label rotamers by a <a href="spin_labeling.html#site_scan">spin-labeling site scan</a> is required.
Unless accessibility is computed for only a single site, <i>labels should not be attached</i>. Otherwise neighboring spin labels may block access to the spin label under consideration, which would be observed in experiments on a singly labelled sample.

This predicts a deuterium three-pulse ESEEM accessibility parameter, as defined in:
<p>
A. Volkov,  C. Dockter, T. Bund, H. Paulsen, G. Jeschke, Biophys. J., 96, 1124-1141 (2009)
<p>
Two files are created in the temporary directory <code>MMM\tmp</code>, a detailed report <code>label_accessibility.dat</code> with information on accessibility of individual rotamers of all labels
and a summary report <code>avg_label_accessibility.dat</code> on average accessibility of each label. The summary report is displayed in the <a href="report_editor.html">report editor</a>.
The underlying approach will be described in a forthcoming paper.

Predicts <sup>31</sup>P Mims ENDOR spectra for a spin label attached to a protein near or within a lipid bilayer or for structures with phosphorous atoms (e.g. protein-DNA and protein-RNA complexes or spin-labeled DNA/RNA.
